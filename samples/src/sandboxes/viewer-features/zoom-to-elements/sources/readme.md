# Zoom To Elements Sample

Copyright Â© Bentley Systems, Incorporated. All rights reserved.

This sample demonstrates how to use the [Viewport.ZoomToElements](https://www.itwinjs.org/reference/core-frontend/views/viewport/zoomtoelements/) API.  The API changes the camera so it is pointing at a specified set of elements.

## Purpose

The purpose of this sample is to demonstrate the following:

- Calling Viewport.ZoomToElement so the user can see a specified set of elements.
- Some of the available options such as: Animate, Margin, and View orientation.

## Descriptions

The Viewport.ZoomToElement is a commonly used API which directs the user's attention to a particular element or group of elements.  The method accepts options from the union of two options structures.  Those are [ZoomToOptions](https://www.itwinjs.org/reference/core-frontend/views/zoomtooptions/) and [ViewChangeOptions](https://www.itwinjs.org/reference/core-frontend/views/viewchangeoptions/).  See the documentation for the full list of options.

This sample allows the user to select one or more elements and add their ids to a table, which is a React component taken from [iTwinUI-react library](https://itwin.github.io/iTwinUI-react/?path=/story/core-table--basic).
